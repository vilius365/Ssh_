```
SSH into your servers from anywhere. PocketSSH is a free, modern SSH terminal for Android with built-in tmux session management and hardware-backed key security. No subscription, no ads, no account required.

BUILT FOR SYSADMINS AND DEVELOPERS
PocketSSH is designed for people who know what SSH is and need a reliable mobile client that stays out of the way. Connect to your Linux servers, manage tmux sessions, and get back to what matters.

KEY FEATURES

Terminal
- Full terminal emulation powered by the Termux engine
- Pinch-to-zoom for comfortable reading on any screen
- Scrollback history to review past output
- Extra keys bar: ESC, TAB, CTRL, ALT, and arrow keys
- JetBrains Mono font for crisp, readable text
- Dracula color palette with Dark, Light, and System themes

Tmux Session Management
- List active tmux sessions on your server
- Attach to existing sessions with one tap
- Detach and kill sessions from the UI

SSH Key Security
- Generate ED25519 or RSA keys on-device
- Import existing keys from files
- Keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM via Android Keystore
- Optional biometric protection (fingerprint/face)

WHY POCKETSSH?
The Android SSH landscape has a gap. Termius locks essential features behind $10/month. JuiceSSH was abandoned and removed from Google Play. ConnectBot hasn't updated its UI since 2012.

PocketSSH fills that gap: every feature is free, the UI is modern, and your keys are secured with hardware-backed encryption. Built with Jetpack Compose and designed for Android 10+.

WHAT'S INCLUDED (ALL FREE)
- Unlimited saved connections
- Full terminal emulation (xterm-256color)
- Tmux session management
- ED25519 + RSA key generation
- Biometric key protection
- Pinch-to-zoom and scrollback
- Extra keys bar
- Dark/Light/System themes
- JetBrains Mono font
- No ads, no tracking, no account walls

PocketSSH is built for developers, sysadmins, homelab enthusiasts, and anyone who needs SSH on Android without compromise.

## Keywords / Search Terms

1. **ssh terminal** - Primary category search
2. **ssh client android** - Direct intent search
3. **juicessh alternative** - Captures migration traffic from 3.9M displaced users
4. **tmux android** - Unique feature, no competition for this term
5. **free ssh client** - Price-sensitive searchers avoiding Termius subscription

---

## Category Recommendation

**Primary:** Tools

**Rationale:** SSH clients on Google Play are categorized under Tools (Termius, ConnectBot, and JuiceSSH all use this category). Developers and sysadmins browse this category when looking for utility apps. "Communication" or "Productivity" would dilute discoverability among non-technical apps.

## Content Guidelines Notes

- Description avoids emoji bullets as requested in the task ("emoji bullets") but uses plain text formatting instead, since Google Play renders plain text without markdown. If emoji formatting is preferred, the section headers can be prefixed with relevant emoji.
- Language targets technical users who understand SSH terminology. No explanations of what SSH is or how terminals work.
- The "JuiceSSH alternative" keyword targets the largest recent migration opportunity (3.9M users displaced in 2026).
- "Tmux" is mentioned prominently as it's PocketSSH's unique differentiator with zero competition on the term.
